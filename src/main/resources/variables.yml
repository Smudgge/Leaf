# Description: Used to create variables that can be used as a
#              placeholder and changed with commands.
#
# Variables can be used to store custom data for each player.
#
# To create a variable, define it in this file then restart the proxy.
# You can then create commands to set the variable and placeholders
# to get the players variable. Variables use <> brackets like standard placeholders.
#
# WARNING: Variable identifiers must be unique to other variables and standard placeholders.
# REQUIREMENT: The database must be enabled.

# # Example <theme> will return the string data that is set for the player.
#
# theme:
#   default: "green"
